                <strong>The Knight</strong> can explore the large, interconnected world of <strong>Hallownest</strong> using a variety of movement and combat techniques.
                In classic Metroidvania style, there are areas of the world that the Knight cannot access until they obtain particular items or abilities.
                Maps for each area must be bought from a shopkeeper generally hidden somewhere in that area,
                and the Knight can also buy upgrades that place markers on the map or allow them to reveal parts of the map as they explore.
                Many areas have a <span class="highlight">"boss"</span> enemy that the Knight must defeat to continue, and have several sub-bosses that drop useful rewards or upgrades.

                Defeated enemies drop <span class="highlight">Geo</span>, a currency that the Knight can use to buy items from shopkeepers.
                If the Knight is killed, they respawn at the last place they rested and lose all their Geo.
                They must then return to their place of death and defeat their Shade to recover the currency.
                The Knight also gains <span class="highlight">SOUL</span> by attacking enemies, which they can then spend to recover lost health or activate special abilities.
                Health can also be recovered at <strong>Hot Springs</strong>, which are located around the world, or by resting at a <strong>Bench</strong>.
