    <h1>Hollow Knight Story</h1>
</header>
<body class="color" id="body">
    <p>
        At the outset, <span class="story-highlight">Knight arrives in Dirtmouth</span>, a quiet town that sits just above the remains of the kingdom of Hallownest.
        As the Knight ventures through the ruins, they learn that Hallownest was once a flourishing kingdom
        which fell after becoming overrun with <span class="story-highlight">"The Infection"</span>, a supernatural disease that can infect anyone who has free will.
        The Infection gives its subjects heightened strength but at the cost of their civility, causing madness and undeath.
        <br><br>
        Hallownest's ruler, <span class="story-highlight">The Pale King</span>, had previously attempted to lock away the Infection in the Temple of the Black Egg.
        Despite the temple's magical seals, the disease managed to escape and Hallownest fell into ruin.
        The Knight's mission is to find and kill three bugs called the <span class="story-highlight">Dreamers</span>, who act as the living seals on the temple door.
        Once the seals have been removed, the Knight may confront the source of the Infection.
        <br><br>
        This quest brings the Knight into conflict with <span class="story-highlight">Hornet</span>, a warrior who tests their combat prowess in several battles.
        Through dialogue with non-player characters, environmental imagery, and writings scattered throughout Hallownest,
        the Knight learns the origins of the Infection.
        In ancient times, a tribe of moths that lived in Hallownest worshipped the <span class="story-highlight">Radiance</span>,
        a primordial being who could control the minds of other bugs. When the Pale King arrived at Hallownest from afar,
        he used his powers to give sapience and knowledge to the creatures of the realm.
        The moths soon joined the other bugs of Hallownest in worshipping the Pale King,
        draining the power of the Radiance as she was slowly forgotten. Beneath the notice of the Pale King,
        some worship of the Radiance continued, allowing her to remain alive inside the Dream Realm.
        Hallownest prospered until the Radiance began appearing in the dreams of its people,
        poisoning their minds with the Infection.
        <br><br>
        In an attempt to contain the menace, the Pale King used an ancient power called <span class="story-highlight">Void</span> to create the <span class="story-highlight">Vessels</span>;
        creatures that could trap the Infection within their own bodies.
        Due to the Vessels being made from Void, they are considered to not have free will,
        thus allowing them to not be infected since they cannot dream.
        The Pale King chose a Vessel known as the <span class="story-highlight">Hollow Knight</span> to trap the Radiance,
        leaving the rest locked in a pit called the Abyss.
        After the Hollow Knight was locked within the Temple of the Black Egg, the Radiance persisted within the Vessel,
        weakening the temple's seals and allowing the Infection to escape.
        <br><br>
        Throughout the game, it is implied that the Knight was a Vessel who managed to escape the Abyss.
        They gradually defeat the Dreamers and their guardians, removing the seals on the door.
        Inside, they encounter and battle with the infected <span class="story-highlight">Hollow Knight</span>.
        Depending on the player's actions, multiple endings can then be achieved.
        <br><br>
        These endings include the Knight defeating the infected Hollow Knight and taking its place containing the Radiance,
        defeating the Hollow Knight with Hornet's assistance,
        or using the Void Heart item to directly fight and defeat the Radiance inside the Dream Realm.
